The memory controller testplan includes a complete set of testcases that
test the memory controller in different scenarios.

**These testcases test the memory controller under single level.**

TESTCASE DESCRIPTION:
====================

Test 01: TASK MIGRATION TEST(1)
-------------------------------
In this test we create two groups(a & b) and run initially two tasks in one
group(a). group b has no task in it. The tasks do anonymous memory allocation
using malloc and after that just keep reading the pages they allocate. So
the memory usage for group a is non zero and group b is zero. After some time
one of the tasks from group a is migrated to group b and the memory usage of
group b is checked. If memory usage of group b is still zero the test passes
otherwise it fails.

Test 02: TASK MIGRATION TEST(2)
-------------------------------
This test is an extension of the above test 1. After migration the task does
memory allocation again and so this time the memory should be claimed from
group b. The test checks if memory is claimed from group b and reports pass
or failure accordingly.

Test03: FAILCNT CHECK TEST
-------------------------------
Whenever tasks in a group try to allocate memory and total memory allocated
becomes more than the limit of that group, the failcnt increases. This test
creates a group with say x limit on memory and runs a task in it with memory
allocation more than group's limit(say y). When y becomes greater than x
it checks if failcnt has increased and reports pass if yes otherwise reports
failure.
* This test will fail if system does not have swap enabled.

Test04: STAT CHECK TEST
-------------------------------
This test is run to check the memory usage from different stats file.
memory.usage_in_bytes gives the current memory usage of the group. memory.stat
file has four fields which give different statistics. The memory usage from
the two files should be same. This test compares these stats and reports pass
if the two values are same and fail if the two values differ.
